# My-First-GitHub-Website

This is the very first application I've created to teach myself about the Git System and utilizing repos to manage my code along the development process.

If you see this, feel free to make any and all suggestions 
for implementing better practices and for writing better code 
so that I can learn the correct way of doing things throughout
the development process or just bring any incorrect info/mistakes/bad practices to my attention.

*Holds up drinking glass*
Here's to the start of my journey as a developer and learning to use GitHub!
